/**
 * Classes used to model a bridge crossing puzzle.
 * <p>
 * <blockquote>Four people need to cross a rickety rope bridge to get back to their camp at night. Unfortunately, they
 * only have one torch and it only has enough light left for seventeen minutes. The bridge is too dangerous to cross
 * without a torch, and it's only strong enough to support two people at any given time. Each of the campers walks at a
 * different speed. One can cross the bridge in 1 minute, another in 2 minutes, the third in 5 minutes, and the fourth
 * takes 10 minutes to cross. How do the campers make it across in 17 minutes?</blockquote>
