java-ai-techniques - Java implementations of common artificial intelligence techniques.
==================

This project contains basic examples of common artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and data structures.

It has been developed for the sole purpose of improving my understanding of AI - rather than a comprehensive collection of efficent scalable techniques appropriate for use in mission critical systems.
