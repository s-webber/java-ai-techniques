[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/webber-s/java-ai-techniques.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/webber-s/java-ai-techniques)

## About

This project contains basic examples of common artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and data structures.

## Purpose

This project has been developed for the sole purpose of improving my understanding of AI - rather than as a comprehensive collection of efficient scalable techniques appropriate for use in mission critical systems.

## Approach

The techniques have been implemented using Java 7 and Google Guava. The unit tests have been implemented using JUnit and jMock.

## Building

The project can be built using Maven, including the production of a code coverage report using JaCoCo.

e.g.: `mvn package`

Javadoc can be produced by doing: `mvn javadoc:javadoc` and will be output to: `target/site/apidocs`
